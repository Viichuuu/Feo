# PracticalWork-II-
This project has consisted of a personal website, it includes information about me, my studies, my social networks or my personal project can be found here.

I was very excited about the project from the beginning because creating a website is something that I had always wanted to do but did not have enough knowledge to do it.

One of the main problems I have encountered is that at first I had misunderstood the project and thought that it was a website on a topic that we wanted and not a personal website, so I started with the idea of ​​the car club and in the middle of the project I had to adapt it and try to reorganize everything and put that initial idea in the "Menu" section, but finally I have managed to adapt everything to the requirements

From the beginning I separated everything into different folders but one of the images wouldn't let me add it to the code and I had to put it in the CSS folder

In conclusion, I found it to be a very interesting project where I have learned a lot, I will use the knowledge acquired in the future.

I would be very interested in continuing to learn about this topic and I have enjoyed doing the project and, although I would have liked the topic to be a little more free, I understand that it is necessary to grade more easily.
